Thank you for considering helping out!

Looking to update information or feature your project? Feel free to make the change yourself. You're in the right place to get started.

## Code of Conduct

Please read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), if you haven't. We take it very seriously.

## Bugs & Enhancements

We are using Github Issues to track public bugs & enhancements. Before filing an issue, we would recommend to try to find known issues first.

When filing an issue, to help us understand it clearly at an early time, please make sure follow the [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) and provide enough information.

## Pull Requests

You are recommended to work your pull requests with a Github Issue (either an existing issue or filing a new one).

### Your First Pull Request

It is our honor to have your first pull request, please see [the video series](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) or [the awesome article](http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/) to get started.

### Sending a Pull Request

There might be some delay because we are also maintaining an internal version that used at Comcast. We will do best to update your pull requests.

Please see the following workflow before sending your pull request:

1. Fork the repository from `master` branch.
2. Install `yarn` and run `yarn` in the project root.
3. Add your code and related test as well.
4. Make sure all tests pass using `yarn test`. Please be aware that your commit would fail if it contains linting failures, we have added the hook to guarantee the styles.
5. Sign the CLA if you haven't.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to sign the [Comcast Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://gist.github.com/ComcastOSS/a7b8933dd8e368535378cda25c92d19a). You only need to do this once, and after that you are good to contribute to all Comcast open source projects.

If you haven't previously signed a Comcast CLA, you'll automatically be asked to when you open a pull request. Alternatively, we can e-mail you a PDF that you can sign and scan back to us. Please send us an e-mail or create a new GitHub issue to request a PDF version of the CLA.
